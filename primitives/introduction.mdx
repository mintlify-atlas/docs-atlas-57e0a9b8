## What are Primitives?

Kumo provides access to **unstyled, accessible primitives** from [Base UI](https://base-ui.com/) - a headless component library built by the MUI team. These primitives give you complete control over styling while handling complex accessibility and behavior logic.

### Primitives vs Components

**Primitives** are low-level, unstyled building blocks that:
- Handle accessibility (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, focus management)
- Manage complex component state and behavior
- Provide full styling control
- Require you to apply your own styles

**Components** (like Kumo's styled components) are:
- Pre-styled with Kumo's design system
- Built on top of primitives or native elements
- Ready to use out of the box
- Customizable via variants and props

## Import Path

All primitives are available under the `@cloudflare/kumo/primitives/` namespace:

```tsx
import { Accordion } from '@cloudflare/kumo/primitives/accordion';
import { Dialog } from '@cloudflare/kumo/primitives/dialog';
import { Tooltip } from '@cloudflare/kumo/primitives/tooltip';
```

You can also import multiple primitives from the barrel export:

```tsx
import { Popover, Slider, Tooltip } from '@cloudflare/kumo/primitives';
```

## Available Primitives

Kumo re-exports the following Base UI primitives:

- [Accordion](/primitives/accordion)
- [Alert Dialog](/primitives/alert-dialog)
- [Autocomplete](/primitives/autocomplete)
- [Avatar](/primitives/avatar)
- [Checkbox](/primitives/checkbox)
- [Collapsible](/primitives/collapsible)
- [Combobox](/primitives/combobox)
- [Dialog](/primitives/dialog)
- [Field](/primitives/field)
- [Menu](/primitives/menu)
- [Popover](/primitives/popover)
- [Select](/primitives/select)
- [Slider](/primitives/slider)
- [Tabs](/primitives/tabs)
- [Tooltip](/primitives/tooltip)

## Official Documentation

For complete API documentation, examples, and guides, refer to the [Base UI documentation](https://base-ui.com/react/components/).

## When to Use Primitives

Use primitives when:
- You need complete control over styling
- You're building custom components with specific designs
- Kumo's styled components don't fit your use case
- You want to create your own component library on top of Kumo

Use Kumo's styled components when:
- You want to ship faster with pre-built designs
- You're following Cloudflare's design system
- You need consistent styling across your application
