## Overview

The Accordion primitive provides an accessible, unstyled accordion component that manages the expansion and collapse of content sections.

## Import

```tsx
import { Accordion } from '@cloudflare/kumo/primitives/accordion';
```

## About

This is a re-export of the Base UI Accordion primitive. It handles:
- Keyboard navigation (Arrow keys, Home, End)
- ARIA attributes for accessibility
- Single or multiple panel expansion
- Controlled and uncontrolled modes

## Usage

```tsx
import { Accordion } from '@cloudflare/kumo/primitives/accordion';

function MyAccordion() {
  return (
    <Accordion.Root>
      <Accordion.Item>
        <Accordion.Header>
          <Accordion.Trigger>Section 1</Accordion.Trigger>
        </Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Panel>
          Content for section 1
        </Accordion.Panel>
      </Accordion.Item>
      <Accordion.Item>
        <Accordion.Header>
          <Accordion.Trigger>Section 2</Accordion.Trigger>
        </Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Panel>
          Content for section 2
        </Accordion.Panel>
      </Accordion.Item>
    </Accordion.Root>
  );
}
```
