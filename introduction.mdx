# Introduction to Kumo

Kumo is Cloudflare's component library for building modern web applications. Built on React, Base UI, and Tailwind CSS v4, it provides a comprehensive set of accessible, themeable UI components.

## What is Kumo?

Kumo is a production-ready React component library designed for building modern web applications. It combines the accessibility primitives of Base UI with Cloudflare's design system, offering 35+ components that work seamlessly together.

## Key Features

### Accessible by Default

Built on [Base UI](https://base-ui.com) primitives, Kumo components follow WAI-ARIA guidelines and are keyboard navigable out of the box.

### Themeable

Kumo uses semantic design tokens that automatically adapt to light and dark modes. Customize the entire theme with CSS custom properties or use the built-in FedRAMP theme.

### Tree-Shakeable

Every component is available as a granular import for optimal bundle size:

```tsx
// Import only what you need
import { Button } from "@cloudflare/kumo/components/button";
```

### TypeScript First

Fully typed with TypeScript, providing excellent autocomplete and type safety for all component props.

### Flexible Styling

Works with Tailwind CSS v4 or as a standalone package with pre-compiled styles. No Tailwind configuration required if you prefer the standalone build.

## Component Categories

Kumo includes components for:

- **Actions** — Buttons, links, dropdowns, menus
- **Forms** — Inputs, selects, checkboxes, switches, date pickers
- **Data Display** — Tables, badges, tooltips, code blocks
- **Feedback** — Toasts, dialogs, loaders, empty states
- **Layout** — Surfaces, grids, tabs, collapsibles
- **Navigation** — Breadcrumbs, pagination, command palette

## Built-in CLI

Kumo includes a command-line interface for quick component reference:

```bash
npx @cloudflare/kumo ls         # List all components
npx @cloudflare/kumo doc Button # Get component documentation
npx @cloudflare/kumo blocks     # Browse installable blocks
```
