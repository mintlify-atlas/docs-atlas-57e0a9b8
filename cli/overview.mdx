icon: 'terminal'
---

The Kumo CLI provides command-line tools for working with Kumo components and blocks. It helps you discover components, access documentation, and install pre-built blocks into your project.

## Purpose and Capabilities

The Kumo CLI serves three main purposes:

### Component Registry Access

Query and explore the Kumo component library from your terminal:
- List all available components with categories
- View detailed documentation for specific components
- Access component props, variants, and examples
- Export complete documentation for all components

### Blocks Distribution

Install pre-built, production-ready UI blocks:
- Browse available blocks (PageHeader, DeleteResource, ResourceList)
- Install blocks directly into your project source
- Automatic dependency detection and reporting
- Import path transformation for seamless integration

### Migration Tools

Handle breaking changes when upgrading Kumo versions:
- Export token rename maps for automated codemod
- Class-level mappings for find-and-replace workflows
- Bidirectional migrations (old-to-new and new-to-old)

## Installation

The CLI is included with the `@cloudflare/kumo` package:

```bash
pnpm add @cloudflare/kumo
```

The `kumo` command is available after installation via:

```bash
npx kumo [command]
```

Or add it to your `package.json` scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "kumo": "kumo"
  }
}
```

## Quick Start

### Initialize Configuration

Before using blocks, initialize a `kumo.json` configuration file:

```bash
npx kumo init
```

This creates a configuration file specifying where blocks should be installed (default: `src/blocks/`).

### List Components

View all available components grouped by category:

```bash
npx kumo ls
```

Example output:

```
Kumo Components (35 total)

Buttons:
  Button - Clickable button element with multiple variants
  IconButton - Button with icon-only display

Data Display:
  Badge - Status indicator with color variants
  Table - Data table with sorting and pagination
  ...
```

### View Component Documentation

Get detailed documentation for a specific component:

```bash
npx kumo doc Button
```

This outputs:
- Component description
- Import path
- Category
- All props with types and descriptions
- Variant options with descriptions
- Code examples
- Semantic tokens used

### Install a Block

Add a pre-built block to your project:

```bash
npx kumo add PageHeader
```

The CLI will:
1. Copy the block files to your configured blocks directory
2. Transform imports to use your installed `@cloudflare/kumo` package
3. Report any component dependencies
4. Show you the import path to use

## Architecture

The CLI is built using Node.js ESM and bundled with the library:

```
@cloudflare/kumo/
├── dist/
│   ├── command-line/
│   │   └── cli.js           # Bundled CLI executable
│   └── index.js             # Library exports
├── ai/
│   ├── component-registry.json  # Component metadata
│   └── USAGE.md                 # AI usage guide
└── src/
    └── blocks/                  # Block source files
```

Key files:
- `cli.ts:1` - Main CLI entry point and command router
- `ai/component-registry.json` - Auto-generated component metadata
- `src/blocks/` - Source code for installable blocks

## Configuration File

The `kumo.json` file is created by `kumo init` and configures CLI behavior:

```json
{
  "blocksDir": "src/blocks",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

### Options

- `blocksDir` - Directory where blocks are installed (relative to project root)
- `version` - Configuration schema version
