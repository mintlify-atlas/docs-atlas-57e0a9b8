# Contributing

Kumo is an open-source project and we welcome contributions from you. Thank you!

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

Kumo is built on the Node.js runtime and uses pnpm for package management:

- **Node.js**: Install the latest LTS version (^24.12.0) — we recommend using a version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- **pnpm**: Install globally with `npm install -g pnpm` (>=10.21.0 required)
- **Code Editor**: We recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the workspace-recommended extensions
- **git**: [Install git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control

### Clone the Repository

**For external contributors:**

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/kumo
cd kumo

# Add upstream remote to stay in sync
git remote add upstream https://github.com/cloudflare/kumo
```

**For Cloudflare employees:**

```bash
# Clone the main repository directly
git clone https://github.com/cloudflare/kumo.git
cd kumo
```

### Install Dependencies

Kumo uses pnpm workspaces to manage the monorepo:

```bash
pnpm install
```

This installs dependencies for all packages in the monorepo.

## Development Commands

### Build and Development

```bash
# Build everything (components + docs + Figma plugin)
pnpm build:all

# Build just the component library
pnpm --filter @cloudflare/kumo build

# Watch mode: rebuilds on file changes
pnpm dev

# Generate primitives and registry metadata
pnpm codegen
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Run all linting checks (oxlint + ESLint)
pnpm lint

# Format code with Prettier
pnpm format

# Type check all packages
pnpm typecheck
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests in the component library
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm --filter @cloudflare/kumo test:coverage

# Run tests with UI
pnpm --filter @cloudflare/kumo test:ui
```

See the [Testing Guide](/development/testing) for detailed information about testing in Kumo.

### Package-Specific Commands

Run commands in a specific package using the `--filter` flag:

```bash
pnpm --filter @cloudflare/kumo <command>
pnpm --filter @cloudflare/kumo-docs-astro <command>
pnpm --filter @cloudflare/kumo-figma <command>
```

## Making Changes

### Create a Branch

Always create a new branch for your changes:

```bash
# Update your main branch
git switch main
git pull upstream main

# Create a new branch
git checkout -b my-feature-name main
```

### Make Your Changes

1. Make your code changes
2. Add tests if applicable
3. Run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm typecheck` to catch errors
4. Test your changes locally with `pnpm dev`

### Stage and Commit

```bash
# Stage your changes
git add <files>

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: add new component variant"
```

## Changeset Workflow

<Warning>
  Every non-trivial change to the `@cloudflare/kumo` package **requires** a changeset. A pre-push hook enforces this requirement.
</Warning>

Changesets capture information about your changes for the changelog and semantic versioning.

### Creating a Changeset

After making your changes and before pushing:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

You'll be prompted to:

1. **Select packages**: Choose `@cloudflare/kumo` for component library changes
2. **Choose version bump type**:
   - **patch** — Bug fixes and minor tweaks
   - **minor** — New features, new components, or significant enhancements  
   - **major** — Breaking changes to the public API
3. **Write a summary**: Describe your changes in 1-2 sentences

### Changeset Best Practices

- **Focus on the "why"**, not the "what" — the diff shows what changed
- **Be concise** — 1-2 sentences is ideal
- **Use present tense** — "Add support for..." not "Added support for..."
- **Reference issues** — Include issue numbers if applicable

**Example changesets:**

```markdown
# Good
Add `disabled` prop to DatePicker to prevent user interaction

# Too detailed
Added a disabled prop to the DatePicker component that accepts a boolean value and when set to true will disable all interactions and apply disabled styling to the component

# Too vague  
Update DatePicker
```

### Stage the Changeset

After creating the changeset, stage the generated file:

```bash
git add .changeset/*.md
git commit -m "chore: add changeset"
```

### When Changesets Are Required

- **Required for `@cloudflare/kumo`**: All changes to the component library
- **Optional for `kumo-docs-astro`**: Documentation changes don't need changesets
- **Not needed for `kumo-figma`**: Figma plugin is not published to npm

## Submitting a Pull Request

### Push Your Branch

```bash
git push -u origin my-feature-name
```

### Create the PR

1. Go to the [Kumo repository](https://github.com/cloudflare/kumo) on GitHub
2. Click "Compare & pull request"
3. **Title format**: `[package] description`
   - Example: `[kumo] Add disabled state to DatePicker`
4. **Fill out the PR template** with details about your changes
5. Submit the PR

### PR Review Process

- A maintainer will review your PR
- Address any feedback by adding new commits (don't force push after review)
- Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR with a squash merge

## Git Best Practices

### Before First Review

- Keep your commit history clean and descriptive
- Squash work-in-progress commits if needed
- Make sure tests pass and lint checks succeed

### After Review

- **Don't force push** — add new commits to address feedback
- Use `git commit --fixup` to mark commits that fix review issues
- The final merge will squash all commits anyway

### PR Title Guidelines

Use conventional commit format for PR titles:

- `feat: add new component`
- `fix: resolve Button focus issue`
- `docs: update installation guide`
- `chore: update dependencies`

## Code Style

Refer to the [Kumo Style Guide](https://github.com/cloudflare/kumo/blob/main/STYLEGUIDE.md) for detailed conventions.

### Key Conventions

- **Only semantic tokens**: Use `bg-kumo-base`, not `bg-gray-100`
- **Never use `dark:` variants**: Dark mode is automatic via CSS custom properties
- **Use `cn()` for className composition**: Always use the `cn()` utility
- **Follow component patterns**: See [Component Structure](/development/component-structure)

## Getting Help

- **Engage early**: For non-trivial changes, create a discussion or comment on an issue before writing code
- **Ask questions**: Comment on the issue or PR if you need clarification
- **Be patient**: The team is actively developing Kumo and will respond as soon as possible

## Release Process

<Note>
  Releases are handled by maintainers. **Never** run version or publish commands yourself.
</Note>

Kumo releases are typically cut on weekdays. If you need a release outside the regular cadence, reach out to the [kumo-maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/cloudflare/teams/kumo-maintainers) team.

## PR Previews

Every PR automatically gets pre-release builds powered by [pkg.pr.new](https://github.com/stackblitz-labs/pkg.pr.new). Links to the pre-release packages are posted as comments on your PR.

You can test your changes in a real project by installing the preview build:

```bash
npm install https://pkg.pr.new/@cloudflare/kumo@<pr-number>
```
